# Tangerine Font Project
by Toshi Omagari

Tangerine is a calligraphic typeface inspired by many italic chancery hands from the 16th and 17th centuries. Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of this type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives a graceful texture. Use Tangerine for titles or short texts at large sizes because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine was named after a woman who encouraged Toshi to begin this work.tosche@mac.com

This project is a fork from the old Google font repository.
